#Welcome to my GitHub repository on Spam Comment Filtering on YouTube using Ensemble Method.
Real time spam comment filtering using ensemble method of classification algorithms for YouTube platform

Problem Statement:			
			One of the major problem  on YouTube is lead owners of famous channels facing problems in comments section of their videos as Spam Comments  with aim to self-promote their videos or disseminate viruses and malwares which disable comment section for that channel.


Aim & Objective:
   		
		 The aim of this project is to design and build tool using Ensemble classification method to detect spam comments in popular channel comment section which leads to disseminate viruses and malwares 

To develop a spam comment monitoring System which will detect disseminate viruses and malwares links in comment section of channel. 
To detect the self promoting / Abuse  comments in video sections
To Label comments as Spam or Ham
To protect users from malicious activities
To show that ensemble method is feasible to get more accurate results

We will make use of Na¨ıve Bayes, K-nearest neighbor and KNN algorithm for the purpose of spam detection in YouTube videos. Using these algorithms we achieve results that are more efﬁcient and accurate in the classiﬁcation of a given comment as a spam. 

Algorithms Used:
Support vector Machine
K-Nearest neighbours
Naive bayes

Language : Python 3.7

Packages Required:
tkinter ,nltk ,sklearn, numpy, pandas ,xslwritter,math ,re,matplotlib
